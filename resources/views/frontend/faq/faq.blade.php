                            The start date of the education year can vary depending on the country, region, or specific
                            school. However, in many countries, the education year typically begins in late summer or
                            early autumn, corresponding with the end of summer vacation.
                            <br />
                            For example, in the United States, the education year often starts in August or September,

                            It's essential to check the academic calendar of the specific school or educational
                            institution your child will be attending to determine the exact start date of the education
                            year. This information is typically available on the school's website or provided during the
                            admissions process.

                            The ideal time to apply for your child's admission to an English medium school depends on
                            various factors such as the school's admissions process, application deadlines, and the
                            start date of the academic year. Generally, it's recommended to start researching potential
                            schools well in advance and attend open houses or information sessions to learn more about
                            them. Be mindful of specific application deadlines and consider applying early, especially
                            for programs or grade levels with early application or priority deadlines. Keep in mind that
                            some schools may offer flexible start dates or mid-year admissions, so it's essential to
                            inquire about these options. Overall, planning ahead and starting the application process
                            early can help ensure a smoother admissions experience for you and your child.
