                Welcome to International Grammar School, Khulna. Parents are indeed the best teachers for a child
                yet in
                today’s world schooling is much needed for each child’s grooming and nurturing to grow and to adapt
                to
                society. Choosing the right school for your child is one of the most important decisions that you
                will
                ever
                make. Exemplary friendly learning environments, better locations, outstanding teachers and support
                staff,
                excellent assessment systems, preferable safety and security, and pioneering educational programs
                are
                certainly key aspects that make a school great and right for your children. With this thought, to
                nurture
                your child as an insightful human being, we have started our journey here in Khulna as International
                Grammar
                School Khulna, often affectionately called IGSK.
            </p>

                We at IGSK focus on building a platform where every child is treated as an individual and gets
                myriad opportunities for their personal development. Thus, we can offer intensive. care with
                outstanding teachers, supporting staff, an excellent assessment system, and preferable safety and
                security to every child. We aimed to promote a stimulating learning environment, whilst striving to
                deliver the Cambridge curriculum which is elaborate, balanced and reflects the literacies and skills
                required in this modern age. Our study program and teaching methods are focused on developing the
                skills such as research, analysis, evaluation, reflection, collaboration and communication. Here in
                IGSK, we continuously urge ourselves to provide a safe place with a child-friendly environment in
                order to let our students develop lifelong skills to cope with the critical and rapidly changing
                world. We believe that our students are global citizens and the learners of 21st century flourishing
                with an empathetic perspective.

                International Grammar School Khulna is the very first ‘BAGLESS SCHOOL’ in Khulna city. Here the word
                ‘Bagless’ symbolizes burden. It expresses our aim: - to reduce the burden of books. Nowadays children
                need to carry a backpack that is heavier than their ability. The heavy backpack carried by the children
                for school is a lifelong threat to their health issue. In our school children do not need to carry the
                burden of books and copies. IGSK only demands the students to bring their desire to learn new things, to
                know more, to question more, and to leave all the stress, burden, and fear behind. IGSK focuses on
