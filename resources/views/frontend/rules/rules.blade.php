        <h4>Our Rules</h4>
        <p>
            Our school builds on mutual trust, cooperation and communication between parents, children and teachers, so
            we will always communicate with each other openly. The school rules have been established to reflect the
            school’s expectations in terms of acceptable standards of behavior, and personal presentation in the widest
            sense.

                Rules for students
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Students are always expected to follow the school rules when they are on the school premises, representing
            the school, attending a school activity or when clearly associated with the school i.e. when wearing the
            school uniform.
        </p>
        <h6 class="fw-bold">Student’s responsibility:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>To attend school regularly.</li>
            <li>To respect the right of others to learn.</li>
            <li>To respect their peers and teachers regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender.</li>
            <li>To respect the property and equipment of the school and others.</li>

            <li>To read all school notices and bring them to their parents/guardians attention.</li>
            <li>To be punctual and to report to school and class on time. School begins at 8:45 a.m. If a student
                arrives in school after 8:45, he/she needs to report to the office to receive a “late pass” from the
                School Admin. Students are discouraged from coming to school prior to 8:30 a.m. because of lack of
                school supervision.</li>
            <li>Students must come to school in neatly laundered uniforms and polished shoes. The hair should be
                trimmed, and the nails must be cut regularly. Girls with long hair should make plaits.</li>
            <li>Strive to be present every school day. In case of absence, parents should call the school in the morning
                of the absence and notify the teacher in writing upon the student's return to school.</li>
            <li>Always Respect each other. Disagreements will be settled by discussing the problem and seeking a
                solution that is fair to all concerned.</li>
            <li>Buildings and the campus will be kept clean and neat. Do not deface or damage school property. Students
                who vandalize the school property will make restitution.</li>
            <li>Maintain order when moving to different areas. Do not run; running is a frequent cause of injuries.</li>
            <li>Any form of verbal or physical, or any means of bullying or victimization is strictly forbidden.</li>
            <li>If a student is going to be absent for any reason in advance, he/she will submit a leave application
                with his/her name, class, contact number and reason for the absence or after an absence from school a
                student must bring, on the day of return, notes signed by his parents/guardian stating the reason for
                the absence and submit it to the class teacher. In the event of an absence exceeding 2 days, the school
                should be informed in writing.</li>
            <li>All articles of clothing, books, and other personal belongings should be clearly marked with the
                student’s name. No responsibility can be accepted for unmarked property. Students losing or finding lost
                property will in the first instance be reported to the class teacher.</li>
            <li>A student must speak in a decent language all the time. He/she must ensure that his/her speech is
                courteous and polite.</li>
            <li>Every student is required to carry the school identity card each day of the school.</li>

            Parents can contact the teacher or any employee at a certain time based on an appointment and tell them what
            they think, as it is important for the successful communication and collaboration between the school and the
            parents. To ensure that your children are happy at school, you should observe the specified class rules. We
            want the satisfaction to be mutual, so we would be happy if some rules were also followed by parents.
