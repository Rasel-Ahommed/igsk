            Early Year Curriculum:
        </h4>
        <h6 class="fw-bold">
            The Early Year school of IGSK comprises Play Group, Kinder I, and Kinder II (age: 3 to 5 years).
        </h6>
        <p>
            The Early Year Stage, defined as the period from birth to the first five years of a child, is a crucial time
            for the development and salient growth of mental and intellectual abilities. In this stage, children are
            highly influenced by the academic environment that surrounds them. As a result, Early Childhood Care and
            Education (ECCE) is more than amplified for the elementary school period. Keeping this in mind, we target
            the holistic development of a child’s cognitive, social, motor, emotional, language skills in order to build
            a solid foundation for lifelong learning.

                For the best learning experience of our young students, we have created classrooms full of creative and
                nurturing environments. We provide the children effective knowledge through playing stuff, multimedia
                and productive activities.
            </li>
            <li>
                We have formed a students’ counseling process which will encourage them to discover themselves more
                rather than engaging in non-cooperative competition.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the overall growth of each child along with cognitive, motor and socialization skills, we focus on
                subjects like English, Mathematics, Science, Bengali, Arts and activity-based subjects which include
                painting, crafting, cooking, multimedia approach and physical education respective to their ages.
            </li>
            <li>
                We follow a blended curriculum for our early year students to give them the best experience of learning.
                Our aim is to flourish children’s reading and oral skills, maintain appropriate pronunciation and
                phonetics and initiate the creative thought process while they are in the Early Years.
            </li>
            <li>
                We consider both English and Bangla as the first languages of a child, so that the root of speaking dual
                languages becomes potent from a very early stage. Besides, our motive is to connect the students with
                Bengali language and culture along with growing up as a global citizen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Learning languages helps the children to grow their analytical ability and to be open towards various
                perspectives of life. For this reason, we focus on learning foreign languages such as Arabic and French.
            </li>
            <li>
                IGSK makes every subject playful using a variety of creative and practical materials. We also prefer
                safe and flexible outdoor learning for a kid’s social, mental and moral augment. With this preference we
                have created well-designed and fully furnished play rooms and gaming rooms where each child can fuel up
                their creative passions beside learning.
